- **Modular Architecture:** Refactoring the codebase into a more modular structure to improve maintainability and scalability.
- **Technical Debt Reduction:** Addressing and resolving various technical debts to ensure a robust and efficient codebase.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implementing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Error Monitoring:** Integrating Sentry for application monitoring and error tracking.
- **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive technical documentation using Sphinx and hosting it on Read the Docs.
